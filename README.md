# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a console-based **Rock Paper Scissors** game developed using HTML and JavaScript. Players can play up to 5 rounds against the computer, and the game will display the winner at the end. This project is my first "big" project as a beginner in web development.

## How to Play

1. Open the developer console in your browser (Right-click -> Inspect -> Console).
2. Follow the prompts to enter your move: **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The game will display the result of each round (win, lose, or draw).
5. The game continues until 5 rounds are played.
6. After 5 rounds, the game announces the overall winner.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Basic structure of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interaction in the console.

## Features

- Play against the computer.
- Random computer move generation.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

4. Follow the prompts in the console to start playing.

## What I Learned

- Basic JavaScript programming concepts.
- Using the browser console for user input and output.
